Getting started
--------------------------------
The internet is home to the biggest information sharing network ever created with billions of devices that communicate across the globe. In developed economies, the average person now owns multiple devices, which are essential to most aspects of daily life. In this digital landscape, everyone is susceptible to getting hacked. Cyber attacks impact large technology companies, financial institutions, media organizations, dating websites, political parties, small companies, and individuals just like us. 

Cybersecurity is important because of the unprecedented amounts of data that we as individuals and organizations collect, store, and process on our electronic devices. As the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, we are all tasked with safeguarding this information. Think about what we need to protect now and in our future!

Individual and family privacy, finances, and health
Business operations, trade secrets, and jobs
Local and national government services
Global commerce, safety, and even world peace
We must all take steps to protect our sensitive, personal information and business information.
 

The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming,
but on our own readiness to receive him;
not on the chance of his not attacking,
but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. 

â€” The Art of War by Sun Tzu
